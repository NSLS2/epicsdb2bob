# epicsdb2bob

CLI utility for auto-creating phoebus engineering screens from EPICS db templates

This is where you should write a short paragraph that describes what your module does,
how it does it, and why people should use it.

Releases        | <https://github.com/jwlodek/epicsdb2bob/releases>

This is where you should put some images or code snippets that illustrate
some relevant examples. If it is a library then you might put some
introductory code here:

```python
from epicsdb2bob import __version__

print(f"Hello epicsdb2bob {__version__}")
```

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here:

```
python -m epicsdb2bob --version
```
